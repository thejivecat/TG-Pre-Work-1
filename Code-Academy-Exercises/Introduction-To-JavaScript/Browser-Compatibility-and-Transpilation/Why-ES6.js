var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

var meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

var sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
var carbonara = "You can make carbonara with " +  varpasta + ", " varmeat + ", " +  "and a sauce made with " + varsauce + ".";
I learned you can format ES6 back to ES5
