const city = 'New York City'
function logCitySkyline(){let skyscraper = 'Empire State Building'; return 'The stars over the ' + skyscraper + ' in ' + city;}
console.log(logCitySkyline())
I learned that you can write variables within blocks which are only accessible from that function or outside of blocks which can be accessed globally
