const logVisibleLightWaves = () => {
  let lightWaves = 'Moonlight';
	let region = 'The Arctic';
  // Add if statement here:
  if (region ==='The Arctic') {let lightWaves = 'Northern Lights';
  console.log(lightWaves)}
  console.log(lightWaves);
};

logVisibleLightWaves();
I learned what happens if you have the same variable defined differently outside and inside the function block
